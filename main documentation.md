2. Search by state and subject to find the standards best suited for your lesson.
3. Tip: Use Ctrl+F to quickly search for words related to your plans.
4. After selecting your state, subject, and standard, you'll return to the main page.

### Step 2: Crafting Your Prompt

The key to getting the best results is writing a specific, detailed prompt. Here's how:

1. Consider the level of detail you want in your lesson.
2. Include multiple aspects of the topic you want to cover.

Example prompts for a Social Studies lesson on the Mongol Empire:

- Basic: "Describe the Mongol Empire"
- Better: "Explain the rise of the Mongol Empire, its conquest of China, Persia, and Europe."
- Best: "Explain the rise of the Mongol Empire, its conquest of China, Persia, and Europe. The reign of Kublai Khan, the travels of Marco Polo and the impact of the Silk Road in bringing Europe and Asia together through trade."

The most detailed prompt will yield the most comprehensive and useful content for your students.

### Step 3: Selecting Grade Level

**Important:** Choose your desired grade level for the prompt. This significantly affects the output.

### Step 4: Generating Your Lesson

1. Enter your detailed prompt in the box under "Enter a theme, topic or discussion here".
2. Select the appropriate grade level.
3. Click the generate button.
